In this wokrshop, modified from a [NYPL Labs tutorial](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2015/01/05/web-maps-primer), we will create a web map from a (scanned) print map of Ann Arbor. This includes: georeferencing a historic map, tracing parks, finding and including historic building data, and putting all content together into an interactive web map.

You can download accompanying data and resources in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/clarkdatalabs/webmapping).
